# Summer Project

In an attempt to examine the presence of any group differences between Peruvian nationals and Venezuelan refugees with regards to Social Emotional Learning, we conduct measurement invariance on a range of different SEL measures for a sample of 823 Grade 3 students and 744 Grade 7 students and their caregivers.

This is a project that I worked on during Summer 2022.
